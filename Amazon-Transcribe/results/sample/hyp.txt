Okay, so the Rubik's Cube comes out in the world, basically in 1980 the next year, the very next year, countries around the world were holding national championships for solving Rubik's Cubes as fast as you possibly could. It's called Speed cubing, Yes, and then a year after that, they all got together all the champions of the countries for the very first Rubik's Cube World Championship in Budapest. Just kind of cool. Um, and that's what has kept people going for so long because there's people are still trying to beat these records. I saw a kid, and it's kind of hard to tell what the top times cause They list the top times in these competitions, but I saw a kid on YouTube do it in, like, six seconds or four or five seconds.
